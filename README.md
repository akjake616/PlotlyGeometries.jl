# PlotlyGeometries.jl



`PlotlyGeometries.jl` is a Julia package designed for creating and manipulating 3D geometrical shapes and visualizations using [`PlotlyJS.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotlyJS.jl). This package provides a variety of functions to easily generate and customize 3D shapes like boxes, spheres, ellipsoids, lines, and arrows, as well as utility functions for transformations and visual enhancements.I hope this package will be useful for those trying to create better illustrations for their academic research using Julia :wink:
